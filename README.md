# Hackspace Magazine Article Code
I'm writing a series of articles in [Hackspace Magazine](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/); the initial plan is for me to write about Arduino development, but who knows what else I'll write about. To make things easier for readers, I created this repository to host all the source code from my articles. As each article is published, I'll update the links below with pointers to the particular folders for each project or project variation.

| Issue | Article                                      | Project Source                         |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Add Arduino power to your projects           | [arduino-led-blink](arduino-led-blink) |
| 2     | Reading digital data on the Arduino platform | [arduino-button-led-1](arduino-button-led-1), [arduino-button-led-2](arduino-button-led-2) |
